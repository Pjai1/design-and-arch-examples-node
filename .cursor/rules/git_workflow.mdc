# Git Workflow Guidelines

- Use feature branches for new development
- Follow conventional commits
- Keep commits small and focused
- Write clear commit messages
- Use pull requests for code review
- Squash merge feature branches
- Keep main branch clean and deployable
- Use meaningful branch names
- Regularly pull from main
- Resolve conflicts promptly

# Git usage

Commit message Prefixes:

- "fix: " for bug fixes
- "feat: " for new features
- "perf: " for performance improvements
- "docs: " for documentation changes
- "style: " for formatting and css changes
- "refactor: " for code refactoring
- "test: " for adding missing integration and unit tests
- "chore: " for chore/build/deploy tasks

# Rules

- use lower case for commit messages
- keep the summary line concise
- when determining the commit prefix, pick the most relevant prefix from the list above
- the commit message can contain a small bullet point list in the commit description of what was changed
- reference issue numbers when applicable
