# Builder Pattern

The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. It allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

## Use Cases

- Creating objects with many optional parameters
- Creating different representations of the same object
- Making object creation more readable and maintainable
- When you need to validate parameters before object creation

## Implementation

The Builder pattern is implemented by:

1. A `User` interface defining the structure of the object to be built
2. A `UserBuilder` interface defining the construction steps
3. A `BobTheBuilder` class that implements the builder interface
4. Method chaining for fluent construction

## Example

```typescript
import { BobTheBuilder } from './index';

// Creating a user with only required fields
const builder = new BobTheBuilder();
const user1 = builder.setFirstName('John').setLastName('Doe').build();

// Creating a user with all fields
const user2 = builder
  .setFirstName('Jane')
  .setLastName('Smith')
  .setAge(30)
  .setEmail('jane.smith@example.com')
  .setPhone('123-456-7890')
  .setAddress('123 Main St')
  .build();
```

## Benefits

- Flexible object construction
- Improved code readability
- Easy to add new parameters
- Type safety
- Separation of concerns between object creation and object representation

## Considerations

- More complex than direct object construction
- Requires more code than simple object creation
- May be overkill for simple objects
- Can make the code more verbose
