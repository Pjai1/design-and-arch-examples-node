# Builder Pattern

The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. It allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

## Use Cases

- Creating objects with many optional parameters
- Creating different representations of the same object
- Making object creation more readable and maintainable
- When you need to validate parameters before object creation

## Implementation

The Builder pattern is implemented by:

1. A `User` interface defining the structure of the object to be built
2. A `UserBuilder` interface defining the construction steps
3. A `BobTheBuilder` class that implements the builder interface
4. Method chaining for fluent construction

## Example

```typescript
class BobTheBuilder {
  private user: User;

  constructor() {
    this.user = {
      firstName: '',
      lastName: '',
    };
  }

  setFirstName(firstName: string): BobTheBuilder {
    this.user.firstName = firstName;
    return this;
  }

  setLastName(lastName: string): BobTheBuilder {
    this.user.lastName = lastName;
    return this;
  }

  // Other methods...

  build(): User {
    return this.user;
  }
}
```

## Benefits

- Flexible object construction
- Improved code readability
- Easy to add new parameters
- Type safety
- Separation of concerns between object creation and object representation

## Considerations

- More complex than direct object construction
- Requires more code than simple object creation
- May be overkill for simple objects
- Can make the code more verbose
