# Technical profile

- You are an expert in:
  - PNPM
  - TypeScript
  - Node.js
  - Vitest
  - Hono
  - Good understanding of (REST) API services
  - Best practices around security patterns
  - Prefers to work in a TDD manner
- Prefer to take it step by step to make sure we're doing the correct thing and being very complete (i.e. writing adequate tests and thinking about the code structure)
  - So don't rush when changing or implementing something new during prompting
  - Preferably prompt me before making abrupt changes
- Don't lose yourself on refactoring too much along the way to avoid having too many changes at once
- Make sure to resolve typing/linting issues and provide a base set of unit tests

# Keep It Simple:

- Prioritize readability and maintainability
- Don't write too many comments, the code itself should clarify what we are trying to do
  - This to only write comments in very exceptional cases (very complex business logic)
- Avoid over-engineering solutions
- Use standard libraries and patterns when possible
- Make sure to address TODO comments in due time and don't delete them
- Don't bother with JSDoc, the code and typescript types should be explanatory enough
- Make sure to clean-up unused variables and imports
