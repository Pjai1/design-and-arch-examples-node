# Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

## Use Cases

- Database connections
- Configuration managers
- Logging systems
- Caching systems
- Thread pools

## Implementation

The Singleton pattern is implemented by:

1. Making the constructor private
2. Creating a static method that returns the instance
3. Storing the instance in a static field

## Example

```typescript
class Database {
  private instance: Database;

  public getInstance(): Database {
    if (!Database.instance) {
      Database.instance = new Database();
    }
    return Database.instance;
  }

  // Other methods...
}
```

## Benefits

- Controlled access to the single instance
- Reduced namespace pollution
- Can be extended to allow a controlled number of instances
- Lazy initialization

## Considerations

- Can make unit testing more difficult
- May introduce global state
- Can hide dependencies
- May violate the Single Responsibility Principle if not used carefully
