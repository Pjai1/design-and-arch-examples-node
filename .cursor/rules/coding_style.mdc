# Coding Standards

- Follow the Airbnb TypeScript style guide.
- Use OXlint linting.
- Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.
- Prefer functional and declarative programming patterns. Use classes judiciously when they provide clear benefits (e.g., for implementing interfaces, managing complex state, or encapsulating related behavior).
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.

# Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories & files(e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Use the \*.spec.ts file naming convention for writing unit tests.

# TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; object typed `as const` are preferred.
- Use advanced TypeScript features (type guards, mapped types, conditional types)
